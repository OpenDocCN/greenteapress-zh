- en: From the earliest history of statistics, there have been two ideas about what
    statistics is. In one view, it is a branch of mathematics with the goal of establishing
    a theoretical foundation for probability and statistical inference. In another
    view, it is a set of tools and practices for working with data, answering questions,
    and making better decisions. Many introductory classes in statistics are based
    on the first view. This book is based on the second.

    general, Python code is more readable – also, because it is executable, the reader
    can run it and modify it to develop insight.

    you can explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating random samples and
    computing their sums. The resulting visualizations show why the CLT works and
    when it doesn’t.

    For example, we approximate p-values by running random simulations, which reinforces

- en: For this third edition, I started by moving the book into Jupyter notebooks.
    This change has one immediate benefit – you can read the text, run the code, and
    work on the exercises all in one place. And the notebooks are designed to work
    on Google Colab, so you can get started without installing anything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The move to notebooks has another benefit – the code is more visible. In the
    first two editions, some of the code was in the book and some was in supporting
    files available online. In retrospect, it’s clear that splitting the material
    in this way was not ideal, and it made the code more complicated than it needed
    to be. In the third edition, I was able to simplify the code and make it more
    readable.

- en: Since the last edition was published, I’ve developed a library called `empiricaldist`
    that provides objects that represent statistical distributions. This library is
    more mature now, so the updated code makes better use of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I started this project, NumPy and SciPy were not as widely used, and Pandas
    even less, so the original code used Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.
    This edition uses arrays and Pandas structures extensively, and makes more use
    of functions these libraries provide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third edition covers the same topics as the original, in almost the same
    order, but the text is substantially revised. Some of the examples are new; others
    are updated with new data. I’ve developed new exercises, revised some of the old
    ones, and removed a few. I think the updated exercises are better connected to
    the examples, and more interesting.
  prefs: []

- en: Since the first edition, this book has been based on the thesis that many ideas
    that are hard to explain with math are easier to explain with code. In this edition,
    I have doubled down on this idea, to the point where there is almost no mathematical
    notation left.

    like it!

- en: The code and data used in this book are available from [AllenDowney/ThinkStats](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats),
    which is a Git repository on GitHub. Git is a version control system that helps
    to keep track of the files that make up a project. A collection of files under
    Git’s control is called a **repository**. GitHub is a hosting service that provides
    storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For each chapter in this book, the repository provides a Jupyter notebook, which
    is a document that contains the text, code, and the results of running the code.
    You can use these notebooks to run the code and work on the exercises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two ways you can run the notebooks. By far the easier one is to use
    Colab, which is a service provided by Google where you can run the notebooks in
    a web browser without installing anything on your computer. If you start from
    the *Think Stats* home page at [https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkStats/](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkStats/),
    you will find links to the notebooks, including one that introduces Colab and
    Jupyter notebooks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t want to use Colab, you can download the notebooks and run them
    on your computer, but in that case you will have to install Python, Jupyter, and
    the libraries the book uses, including NumPy, SciPy, and StatsModels. If you have
    experience installing software, setting up an environment where you can run the
    notebooks is not difficult. But if you don’t have that experience, your first
    attempt can be challenging, and sometimes frustrating. In that case, it can be
    a barrier to getting the most out of this book. If you want to learn about exploratory
    data analysis in Python, you don’t want to spend your time and cognitive capacity
    on installing software!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So I strongly recommend that you run at least the first few chapters on Colab.
    Then, if you want to set up your own environment, you can do it without interrupting
    your progress in the book. And one last suggestion: if you have any problems installing
    software, take advantage of tools like ChatGPT – they generally provide good guidance
    on these topics.'
  prefs: []

- en: I wrote this book assuming that the reader is familiar with core Python, including
    object-oriented features. If you are familiar with NumPy and Pandas, that will
    help, but it’s not necessary – I’ll explain what you need to know. I assume that
    the reader knows basic mathematics, including logarithms, for example, and summations.
    You don’t need to know linear algebra or calculus. There is one place where I
    mention derivatives and integrals, but if you are not familiar with those concepts,
    they are entirely optional. Finally, I don’t assume you know anything about statistics.
